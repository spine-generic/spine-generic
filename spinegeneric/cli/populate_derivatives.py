# If manual correction files are all located in a flat directory, as was the case at the beginning of the project, this
# script copies each file under the proper derivatives/ directory.
# The directory is found by parsing the file name, and looking for the 'subject' field and the 'contrast' field (to
# decide if a data goes under anat/ or dwi/).
#
# Assumptions:
# - all data are .nii.gz
# - subject name is first prefix separated by "_". Example: sub-tokyo750w_dwi_crop_moco.nii.gz -> sub-tokyo750w
# - output folder is derivatives/labels/
#
# How to run:
# Go to the directory that includes all the manual corrections (they should all be present in the ./ folder) and run:
#   sg_populate_derivatives <PATH_TO_BIDS_DATASET>
